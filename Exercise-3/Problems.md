**2.1)** They are different sizes with short and int being 16 bits, long
being 32 bits, and long long being 64 bits. Float and double allow
decimals with doubles being the larger of the two. Being signed means 1
bit is reserved for the number being either positive or negative.
**2.2)** For each of the 3 I would use floats. The numbers require
decimals but not to the level of a double **2.3)** 32 -32 0 0 **2.10)**
The strings will be empty. The local int will have a defualt value and
the global int will be 0. **2.12)** a, c, d **2.13)** 100 **2.14)** 100
45 **2.17)** 10 10 **2.27)** c, &r can only be bound to a const value
